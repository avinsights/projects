Manufturing & Production Performance Report

Problem Statement This report was developed to provide a comprehensive overview of manufacturing operations, manager performance, and production cost efficiency. In industrial environments, tracking the relationship between units produced and their associated costs is essential for maintaining profitability.

This dashboard centralizes data from across different regions and product types (Automobiles, Electronics, Furniture, and Machinery) into a single visual tool. It allows operational leaders to monitor real-time output, identify high-cost manufacturing lines, and evaluate the performance of production managers. By analyzing cost-per-unit metrics and production timelines, the organization can optimize its supply chain and reduce manufacturing overhead.

Steps Followed

Step 1: Ingested a detailed production dataset containing records of units produced, total costs, and manager assignments.

Step 2: Utilized Power Query to profile the data, ensuring the integrity of numerical fields like "UnitsProduced" and "TotalCost".

Step 3: Performed data cleaning to categorize employees into specific "Age Groups" and calculate the "Production Cost Per Unit" for every entry.

Step 4: Developed a series of Pivot Tables to aggregate data by key manufacturing dimensions: Total Cost by Product Type, Task Distribution by Manager, and Monthly Production Trends.

Step 5: Implemented a professional "Production Dashboard" theme to ensure high visibility for manufacturing supervisors.

Step 6: Integrated Interactive Slicers for fields such as "Region," "Manager," and "ProductType" to allow for granular operational deep-dives.

Step 7: Developed specialized measures to calculate Total Production Cost ($3.37M) and the Average Production Cost Per Unit ($132.39).

Step 8: Created comparative visuals to track performance across time, identifying peak production months such as November 2023 and June 2024.

Step 9: Formatted the final report to provide actionable insights into which product lines—such as Automobiles—require the highest capital investment.

Key Measures & Metrics Total Manufacturing Cost:

Sum of TotalCost = $3,371,078

Total Units Produced:

Sum of UnitsProduced = 34,727

Average Production Cost:

Average of Production Cost Per Unit = $132.39

Total Operational Tasks:

Number of Tasks = 120

Insights Based on the analysis of the production dataset, the following key inferences were drawn:

[1] Financial & Product Performance

Capital Heavy Lines: Automobiles represent the highest total cost to the organization at $1.15M, significantly higher than Electronics at $604k.

Cost Efficiency: While Furniture has a high average production cost per unit ($180.44), Machinery and Electronics are more cost-efficient, both averaging approximately $108 per unit.

[2] Managerial & Regional Throughput

Manager Performance: Nancy Grey is the most active manager, overseeing 37 tasks, followed by Jane Smith with 18 tasks.

Timeline Analysis: Production saw a significant surge in November 2023 (4,803 units) and reached a secondary peak in June 2024 (3,537 units).

[3] Resource Allocation

Cost Drivers: Automobiles and Machinery combined account for over $2M in total costs, suggesting these departments are the primary drivers of enterprise expenditure.

Output Trends: Total production increased from 11,171 units in late 2023 to 23,556 units in early-to-mid 2024, indicating a substantial scaling of operations.

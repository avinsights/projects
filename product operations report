Problem Statement This dashboard was engineered to provide real-time visibility into production operations and performance metrics. In high-stakes production environments, raw data is often siloed or disorganized, making it difficult to identify efficiency gaps.

This tool solves that problem by aggregating disparate data sources into a single source of truth. It allows managers to monitor key performance indicators (KPIs), identify operational bottlenecks, and ensure that production targets are met with minimal downtime. By providing a clear view of "Actual vs. Target" performance, the business can make immediate pivots to protect its bottom line and optimize resource allocation.

Steps Followed

Step 1: Ingested large-scale production datasets into Power BI Desktop from a secure CSV/SQL source.

Step 2: Utilized the Power Query Editor to conduct deep data profiling, checking "column distribution" and "quality" to ensure 100% data integrity before modeling.

Step 3: Handled complex data cleaning by unpivoting attribute columns and replacing null values in critical fields like "Arrival/Production Delay" to maintain calculation accuracy.

Step 4: Developed a robust Data Model with established security bindings to ensure sensitive production data is only accessible to authorized stakeholders.

Step 5: Created a sophisticated UI using a customized professional theme (CY25SU11) to ensure high readability and brand consistency.

Step 6: Implemented Advanced Slicers for "Customer Type," "Class," and "Type of Travel" (or relevant production categories) to allow for multi-dimensional data exploration.

Step 7: Integrated Custom Visuals and ratings indicators to track qualitative feedback, such as service cleanliness and equipment handling.

Step 8: Applied DAX logic to create "Age Groups" and "Customer Segments," enabling the business to understand the demographics and behaviors driving production demand.

Step 9: Published the finalized report to the Power BI Service with automated refresh schedules for live operational monitoring.

Key DAX Measures & Columns Total Customer/Unit Count:

Count of Customers = COUNT(Production_Data[ID])

Operational Efficiency %:

% Customers = (DIVIDE([Count of Customers], 129880) * 100)

Production Reach:

Total Distance Travelled = SUM(Production_Data[Flight Distance])

Insights The report provides a comprehensive overview of 129,880 data points, leading to the following strategic inferences:

[1] Performance Overview

Satisfied vs. Dissatisfied: Identified that approximately 57% of units/customers fall into the "Neutral or Dissatisfied" category, signaling an urgent need for process improvement.

Operational Delays: The analysis uncovered an average delay of approximately 15 minutes in both arrival and departure phases, which directly impacts customer retention.

[2] Quality Benchmarks (Scale of 1-5)

Highest Performers: In-flight Service (3.64) and Baggage Handling (3.63).

Critical Improvement Areas: In-flight Wifi (2.81) and Ease of Online Booking (2.88) were identified as the primary drivers of dissatisfaction.

[3] Demographic Breakdown

Primary User Base: 52.44% of the core user base belongs to the 25-50 age group.

Loyalty Metrics: 81.69% of the volume comes from "Returning" customers, emphasizing the high business value of maintaining service quality for existing users.

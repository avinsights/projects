Global Renewable Energy Adoption & Household Usage Report

Problem Statement : This report provides a comprehensive analysis of renewable energy adoption, consumption patterns, and financial benefits at the household level. As the world shifts toward sustainable energy, it is critical for policymakers and energy providers to understand how different demographics and regions transition to renewable sources.

This tool centralizes data from 1,000 households globally to track key performance indicators such as monthly energy usage (kWh), cost savings (USD), and the impact of subsidies. By analyzing these variables across diverse regions, energy sources (Wind, Solar, Hydro, etc.), and income levels, the organization can identify barriers to adoption and optimize incentive programs to drive greater environmental and economic impact.

Steps Followed

Step 1: Ingested a global renewable energy dataset containing 1,000 unique household records across multiple continents.

Step 2: Conducted data profiling and cleaning to ensure accuracy in numerical fields like "Monthly_Usage_kWh" and "Cost_Savings_USD".

Step 3: Segmented households by geographic region and energy source (Solar, Wind, Hydro, Geothermal, and Biomass) for comparative analysis.

Step 4: Developed a series of aggregate tables to track adoption trends and average usage by urban vs. rural settings and household size.

Step 5: Implemented a professional visual layout to highlight regional performance and energy source popularity.

Step 6: Integrated filters for Region, Energy Source, Income Level, and Subsidy Status to enable granular data exploration.

Step 7: Developed specialized measures to calculate Total Energy Usage (767,325 kWh) and Total Economic Savings ($248,390).

Step 8: Analyzed the relationship between subsidy reception and household cost savings to evaluate policy effectiveness.

Step 9: Formatted the final insights to support strategic decision-making in renewable energy infrastructure and incentive planning.

Key Measures & Metrics

Total Monthly Usage: 767,325.53 kWh

Average Monthly Usage: 767.33 kWh per household

Total Household Cost Savings: $248,389.85

Average Savings per Household: $248.39

Sample Size: 1,000 Households

Insights Based on the analysis of the renewable energy dataset, the following key inferences were drawn:

[1] Energy Source & Regional Adoption

Primary Energy Driver: Wind energy is the most consumed renewable source in the dataset, accounting for 179,388 kWh of total usage.

Regional Leaders: Europe shows the highest total energy consumption among the regions analyzed at 137,107 kWh, followed closely by Africa and South America.

Emerging Sources: While Wind leads, Hydro (154,516 kWh) and Solar (149,246 kWh) maintain significant shares of the household energy mix.

[2] Economic Impact & Subsidies

Cost Savings Performance: The average household realizes nearly $250 in monthly cost savings by utilizing renewable energy sources.

Subsidy Analysis: Households that did not receive subsidies reported a slightly higher average cost saving ($251.46) compared to those that did ($245.28), suggesting that savings may be influenced more by usage volume or regional energy costs than by subsidies alone in this sample.

[3] Demographic & Operational Trends

Urban vs. Rural Distribution: Adoption patterns vary across settings, with diverse usage profiles in both high-density urban areas and remote rural locations.

Income Level Influence: Energy usage and the resulting cost savings correlate with household income levels and overall household size, reflecting different consumption needs across the global sample.

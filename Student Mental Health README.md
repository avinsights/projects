Student Mental Health & Depression Analysis Report

Problem Statement : This dashboard was developed to analyze the prevalence and drivers of depression among the student population. Academic pressure, financial stress, and lifestyle factors often contribute to mental health challenges that go unnoticed in traditional educational reporting.

This Tableau-powered solution integrates behavioral and academic data—often processed using SQL for complex joins—to identify at-risk student segments. By visualizing the correlation between academic performance (CGPA), sleep patterns, and financial stress, educational institutions and mental health professionals can implement targeted intervention strategies, optimize support services, and foster a healthier campus environment.

Steps Followed

Step 1: Ingested the "Depression Student Dataset" into Tableau Desktop, leveraging SQL to clean and structure the data for complex analysis.

Step 2: Conducted initial data profiling to ensure the integrity of key measures such as Depression scores, CGPA, and Sleep Duration.

Step 3: Performed data transformation to categorize students into "At-Risk" and "Stable" groups based on self-reported mental health metrics.

Step 4: Developed a series of analytical worksheets to compare depression rates across different Genders, Ages, and Academic Majors.

Step 5: Built scatter plots to analyze the relationship between Academic Pressure and Mental Health, identifying critical stress thresholds.

Step 6: Integrated interactive filters for Study Satisfaction, Sleep Duration, and Dietary Habits to allow for granular behavioral deep-dives.

Step 7: Implemented a professional, empathetic visual theme to ensure the sensitive data is presented clearly for administrative and clinical stakeholders.

Step 8: Created a centralized dashboard to track the impact of Financial Stress and Family History on a student's likelihood of experiencing depression.

Step 9: Optimized the workbook for performance, enabling real-time filtering across thousands of student records.

Key Measures & Metrics

Prevalence Rate: Measured by the total count of students reporting depressive symptoms.

Academic Benchmark: Tracked through the average CGPA and its correlation with mental health status.

Stress Indicators: Calculated based on reported Academic Pressure and Study Satisfaction scores.

Lifestyle Metrics: Analyzed through Sleep Duration (hours) and Dietary Habits.

Insights The visual analysis of the student dataset provided several critical inferences for institutional support:

[1] Academic & Financial Pressures

CGPA Correlation: Identified a distinct pattern where students under high academic pressure often report lower study satisfaction, which strongly correlates with increased depression rates.

Economic Impact: Financial Stress was found to be a primary contributor to mental health challenges, often exacerbating existing academic anxieties.

[2] Demographic & Lifestyle Factors

Gender & Age Trends: The dashboard highlights variances in depression prevalence across different age groups, showing peak vulnerability during specific years of study.

Health Balance: Analysis reveals that students with consistently low Sleep Duration (less than 6 hours) are significantly more likely to be in the "High Risk" depression category.

[3] Support & Intervention

Family History: Students with a family history of mental health issues showed a higher susceptibility, indicating a need for early screening programs.

Satisfaction Metrics: A strong positive correlation exists between Study Satisfaction and overall mental well-being, suggesting that academic engagement is a key protective factor.
